# eDNA_extractions_protocols
Details steps for extrations protocols that we have used


Extraction protocol from Lever et al. 2016

Overall precautions
1.	Take every precaution to reduce contamination, including cross contamination
2.	Always were gloves
3.	Make sure all materials are cleaned with best available method
4.	Clean table every morning before beginning
5.	Clean gloves with DNA killer often, especially when using aspirator (vacuuming solution)

For extracting extra and intracellular
1)	Weight and aliquot Sample in 50 ml centrifuge tubes
2)	Shake tube to mix sediment and make it easier to remove sample
  a)	Weight out sample-1 g
    i)	If already had phosphate buffer added (old protocol)
      (1)	Add DNA extracted from commercial kit
      (2)	Skip step 3
3)	PO4 Addition
  a)	Organic rich and sandy sediments
    i)	100 mol PO4 g-1
    ii)	Needs to have pH>9
        (1)	If new set of samples test with pH meter on extra sample
    iii)	Add and gently mix for 30 min?
4)	Add CDM
   a)	1:1 CDM ml to sample g (1 ml for 1 g of sample)
  b)	Gently mix, room temperature, 1 hour
  c)	Add 8 volumes of 10x TE buffer (8.0 ml of TE per 1 g sample)
    i)	Check pH, should be >9 or 10 !! Add 2 drop of NaOH…….
  d)	Gently mix, room temperature, 1 hour
  e)	Centrifuge for 20 min at 10,000xg 
5)	Separation of extra and intracellular
  a)	For extracellular
    i)	Filter supernatant through 0.2 m filter and transfer to clean 50ml tube
    ii)	Label and freeze leftover sediment (for intracellular extraction)
6)	First precipitation 
  a)	Concentrate eDNA using PEG-NaCl precipitation
  b)	Add linear polyacrylamide (LPA) for final LPA conc. of 20 l per ml 
    i)	Add 15.4 l at 14 mg/ml for 1 g sediment (In 50 ml tube)
  c)	PEG-NaCl precipitation
    i)	Mix with 30% w/v PEG 6000 and 1.6 M NaCl x 2 volume of sample
    ii)	Homogenize by hand shaking for 30 sec. (you can use a vortex few seconds)
    iii)	Incubate at room temperature in dark for 2 hours (or overnight at 4C)
    iv)	Centrifuge 14,000xg for 60 min 
    v)	Pipette off supernatant and keep pellet using vacuum
      (1)	Change tips after each sample
      (2)	Clean gloves and vacuum tube with DNA killer
    vi)	Be very careful and avoid pellet loss (why two ethanol washes are needed)
      (1)	Hold vial vertical and draw from top of liquid
      (2)	Leave 50 l of liquid to ensure that pellet is left!
    vii)	Add 70% ethanol (5 ml to 15ml tube)
    viii)	Vortex for 3 sec
    ix)	Centrifuge 10 min at 14,000xg
    x)	Remove supernatant
    xi)	Repeat ethanol addition, centrifuge, and remove supernatant, keep pellet
    xii)	Use vacuum centrifuge (45C) to remove liquid (15 min)
        (1)	Do not over dry (will be harder to dissolve)
7)	Cleanup of extracellular
  a)	Dissolve pellet in 200 l water
  b)	Transfer DNA solution to 1.5 tube
  c)	Add 500 l of lysis solution I
  d)	Gently shake for 1 hour at 50C (350 rpm)
  e)	Centrifuge 10-20 min at 10,000xg and 4C
  f)	Supernatants containing DNA is transferred to clean tube
8)	Purification
  a)	Begin cooling centrifuge to 4C
  b)	Add 1 volume of Chloroform-isoamylalcohol (CI)
  c)	Vortex at max speed for 10 sec
  d)	Centrifuge for 10min at 10,000xg at 4C
  e)	Transfer supernatant into clean tube, avoid precipitates
    i)	Take top aqueous layer, leave precipitants in between layers and bottom layer
  f)	Repeat CI addition, vortex, centrifuge, transfer supernatant to clean tube (7a-d)
    i)	Should be no visible precipitates
9)	Second Precipitation 
  a)	Add linear polyacrylamide (LPA) for final LPA conc. of 20 l per ml 
    i)	0.7 l at 14 mg/ml for 500l solution (In 1.5 ml tube)
  b)	PEG-NaCl precipitation
    i)	Mix with 30% w/v PEG 6000 and 1.6 M NaCl x 2 volume of sample
    ii)	Homogenize by hand shaking for 30 sec. (you can use a vortex few seconds)
    iii)	Incubate at room temperature in dark for 2 hours (or overnight at 4C)
    iv)	Centrifuge 14,000xg for 30 min
    v)	Pipette off supernatant and keep pellet using vacuum
      (1)	Change tips after each sample
      (2)	Clean gloves and vacuum tube with DNA killer
    vi)	Be very careful and avoid pellet loss (why two ethanol washes are needed)
      (1)	Hold vial vertical and draw from top of liquid
      (2)	Leave 20 l of liquid to ensure that pellet is left!
    vii)	Add 70% ethanol (1 ml to 1.5 ml tube)
    viii)	Vortex for 3 sec
    ix)	Centrifuge 10 min at 14,000xg
    x)	Remove supernatant
    xi)	Repeat ethanol addition, centrifuge, and remove supernatant, keep pellet
    xii)	Use vacuum centrifuge (45C) to remove liquid (2 min for 1.5 ml tube)
      (1)	Do not over dry (will be harder to dissolve)
  c)	Dissolve pellet in 100l of water or tris
d)	Sample ready for PCR
